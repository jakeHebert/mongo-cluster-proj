For this project, we chose to use MongoDB. We have gone over MongoDB some in this class as well as a few other classes, so we were familiar with it. This allowed us to save time instead of spending time learning how to use a new DB. MongoDB is also fairly lightweight and easy to use with the VCL VMs, making it a convenient choice. We learned how to setup not only a sharded DB, but also how to set up replica sets. We learned how the different type of Mongo servers interact with each other to form a sharded cluster. We also were able to become more familiar with Docker and docker-compose, as we used containers to deploy the database servers. 
We chose to use Python as the scripting language for our project. We have both taken a few classes in Python at this point. We learned how to configure Mongo servers in Python, something that was much easier than I expected and automates things when creating new DBs and collections. We also learned how to reda csv data properly in Python.
